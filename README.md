📖 About The Project

VEENU is an immersive, consumer-facing website designed for a premium highway restaurant located on the Indore Bypass.

Originally conceptualized as a branding case study, this project was evolved into a fully functional, high-performance landing page. It focuses on translating the physical ambiance of the restaurant into a digital experience through fluid motion, cinematic storytelling, and AI-driven interactivity.

✨ Key Features

⚠️ Note on Security

This project uses a client-side API key injection for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, API calls should be routed through a backend server to keep the API key hidden from the frontend.
